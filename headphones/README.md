This project is part of the ALX Front-End Engineering curriculum. The goal is to recreate a responsive landing page based on a Figma design using only HTML and CSS.

## 📌 Figma File
Create a Figma account and open the design project.  
Click **“Duplicate to your Drafts”** to get full access to inspect layouts, spacing, fonts, and colors.

If the main link does not work, use the backup Figma link provided on the ALX intranet task page.

## 🖋 Fonts
The design uses the following fonts:

- **Source Sans Pro**
- **Spin Cycle OT**

If these fonts are not installed on your system, download them using the links provided in the project instructions.

> Some values in Figma are floating numbers.  
> You can **round them** when coding.

## 📱 Responsive Design Rules
- The layout **must switch to the mobile version at screen widths of 480px or less**.
- The maximum width of the content is **1000px**, centered on the page.

---

## 🎨 Interaction Styles
- **Links (hover/active):** `#FF6565`
- **Buttons (hover/active):** `opacity: 0.9`

These interactions must match the Figma prototype.
